## Plan (lifecycle)

### Done `#implemented`

Verified against code — these features are shipped and working.

| Area | What's in |
|------|-----------|
| **Engine** | Three.js scene, 100x100 map (terrain, 3 lanes, river, base pads), camera, game loop. |
| **Menu** | Main menu, Play (side + team size), Settings, Hero Viewer (all 20 heroes: 3D preview, animations, stats, skills, level slider), Lobby, hero pick → start. Hero Viewer is first/default Settings tab (auto-loaded on open); mobile landscape layout compacted via CSS media queries. Menu polish: Back labels use `🔙` icon style, and main-menu buttons are fixed to equal width for cleaner alignment. |
| **Heroes** | 20 heroes with 3D models, stats, Q/W/E/R skills. Per-hero modules in `js/heroes/` (registry, _template). Lich, Sniper, Dragon Knight, Shadow Fiend, Windrunner, Axe, Pudge, Sven, Tidehunter, Earthshaker, Phantom Assassin, Juggernaut, Drow Ranger, Bounty Hunter, Vengeful Spirit, Crystal Maiden, Zeus, Lina, Lion, Enigma. |
| **Combat** | Melee/ranged attacks, projectiles, physical/magic/pure damage, armor, lifesteal, death, respawn timer. |
| **Creeps** | Lane creeps (melee + ranged), waypoints, last hit, deny, XP, gold. |
| **Neutral camps** | 6 camps, tiered units, leash radius, respawn timer, gold/XP rewards. |
| **Structures** | 18 towers (tier 1–4), 6 barracks (destroyable, HP, death → mega-creep upgrade), 2 Ancients (win condition). |
| **Items** | 13 items (6 basic, 6 upgrade, TP Scroll), recipes, passives, actives (Blink, Teleport, Mana Restore, Void Burst), shop, 6-slot inventory. TP Scroll full spec: stun cancels channel entirely (not just pauses); player selects any allied tower as TP target via click-to-target mode with HUD banner; base fountain fallback; Escape to cancel. |
| **HUD** | Top bar (portraits, HP, time, gold), hero bars (HP/MP/XP/level/KDA), skill bar (Q/W/E/R, cooldowns, mana), attack button, inventory (2×3 grid right-side above skillbar), shop button (top of inventory panel), minimap (click-to-pan), announcer (First Blood, Kill Streak, Barracks Fallen, etc.). Layout improved: inventory moved from bottom-center to right side freeing up game view; HUD panels semi-transparent (idle-fade to 0.35 after 4s); camera offset reduced to keep hero more centered. |
| **Match end** | Victory / Defeat screen on Ancient destruction. |
| **Multiplayer** | Trystero networking (`js/net/`: peer, protocol, host, client, lobby). Create/Join game, room code, QR code, hero pick (both host and client pick own hero in lobby), host starts; host broadcasts state snapshots. **Migrated PeerJS → Trystero (torrent strategy)**: signaling now uses distributed BitTorrent tracker infrastructure instead of a single cloud server (`0.peerjs.com`) — eliminates the recurring "Connection timed out" failure. 20 s join timeout, `cancelJoin()`, Back button abort, `hostReady` handshake all preserved. 4× Google STUN + openrelay TURN still configured for symmetric-NAT traversal. Trystero loaded via `esm.sh` CDN import in `js/net/peer.js`; external peer API unchanged so all callers are unaffected. |
| **Controls** | Desktop (arrow keys, click move/attack, Q/W/E/R, Space stop, scroll zoom, B shop). Mobile (joystick, attack button, skill buttons). |
| **AI** | Hero bots (lane march, fight, retreat, fountain regen, skill casting, item buying). Creep AI (lane pathing, target priority). **Bot difficulty presets** (Easy/Normal/Hard) tuning retreat HP threshold, cast reaction time, spell accuracy, and item-buy frequency — lobby UI selector wired through `js/ai.js` → `js/items.js`. |
| **Audio** | 18 SFX (hit, ranged, magic, death, levelup, gold, spawn, respawn, tower hit/death, frost, shrapnel, chain frost, assassinate channel/fire, fire, windrun, buy). Procedural main theme. **SFX wiring:** playSFX(name) in js/audio.js with Web Audio fallback beeps when sounds/ empty; called at damage (applyDamage), death (killUnit, applyCreepDamage), buy (buyItem), gold (grantBounty); levelup supported—call playSFX('levelup') when hero level increases. |
| **Polish VFX** | Level-up ring burst: two `spawnRing` calls (gold 1.5u + white 0.8u) added to `onLevelUp()` in `combat.js`. Hero death white flash: `group.traverse` sets emissive to white on kill, `setTimeout 200ms` hides the group. Respawn rotation fix: `animations.js` now checks `_prevAnim === 'die'` before overwriting it, resetting `group.rotation.x/z` when leaving die state. |
| **Minimap fog of war & entity dots** | Enemy heroes hidden on minimap unless within vision of any allied hero (15u), tower (12u), or creep (10u). Barracks dots drawn (green=allied, red=enemy). Recenter ⌖ button below minimap snaps camera to player hero. (js/hud.js, index.html, js/main.js) |
| **Ability UX — drag-to-aim & double-tap** | Mobile skill buttons (Q/W/E/R) support three gestures: (1) drag >20px → gold arrow aim indicator at touchstart, casts at lift-off world position (raycasted to ground plane); (2) double-tap within 300ms → auto-casts on nearest enemy hero within 500u; (3) single tap → existing click-to-confirm targeting mode. Pulsing "TAP TARGET" hint above skill bar during targeting. Escape cancels targeting mode. (js/controls.js, index.html) |
| **Leveling & skill learning UX** | Dota-like skill progression integrated: heroes no longer start with all 4 skills. Player starts with 1 skill point and learns Q/W/E/R manually; level-up grants +1 skill point instead of auto-leveling. Ultimate learns are gated at hero levels 6/11/16. HUD adds skill-point counter, per-skill `+` learn buttons, locked/unlearned/learnable visual states, and active/passive/toggle badges; desktop supports `Ctrl/Meta/Alt + Q/W/E/R` to learn quickly. Hero Viewer now labels skill type from real `skillTypes` data (Active/Passive/Toggle). (js/state.js, js/main.js, js/combat.js, js/skills.js, js/hud.js, js/controls.js, js/hero-viewer.js, index.html, locales/en.json, locales/vi.json) |
| **Skill range-cast SDLC** | Skill cast range taxonomy in plan.md (global, self, short/medium/long, passive, toggle). All 20 heroes × 4 skills documented in [heroes/](heroes/index.md) with explicit **Range** per skill. Zeus R (Thundergod's Wrath) marked global; SF Q/R and similar special cases defined. Hero modules support `castRangeByLevel` (Lich, Zeus, Sniper as examples). (docs/plan.md, docs/heroes/, js/heroes/_template.js, js/heroes/lich.js, js/heroes/zeus.js, js/heroes/sniper.js) |
| **Attack button range gate** | Attack button (👊) is dimmed and non-tappable (`pointer-events:none`, opacity 0.28) when no enemy/neutral creep is within attack range. As soon as a target enters range it activates: full opacity, red glow, pulsing `atkPulse` animation — gives clear "you can attack now" signal. Same range threshold as the attack action (`hero.def.range + 4`). Checked every frame in `updateHUD()`. (js/hud.js, index.html) |
| **Mobile skill UX — MOBA-style passive/toggle/aim** | Passive skills: greyed-out buttons (opacity 0.45, pointer-events:none) with 'P' badge — cannot be tapped, flash briefly if pressed. Toggle skills (Drow Frost Arrows Q, Pudge Rot W): tap to toggle on/off, blue glow when active (`skill-toggled-on` CSS). Drag-to-aim snaps to nearest enemy unit within 7 world units of the aimed position — greatly improves unit-target skills on mobile. Double-tap now includes neutral creep camps as valid auto-targets. Drow Ranger Frost Arrows reworked: true toggle (no timer), orb effect hooked into attack loop — slows target 1.5–3s + bonus 15–45 magic dmg scaled by skill level; projectile turns blue when active. `skillTypes` metadata (`'passive'`/`'toggle'`/`'active'`) added to all 20 hero modules. (js/hud.js, js/skills.js, js/controls.js, js/heroes/*.js, js/main.js, index.html) |
| **Loading screen** | Full-screen overlay shown immediately at page load (pure HTML/CSS, no JS dependency). Progress bar tracks CDN script loading (Three.js → Howler → QR → main.js init) with stage labels. Menu buttons disabled until JS fully initializes; re-enabled and overlay fades out on `_appReady()`. Slow-connection warning shown after 90s; CDN error shown inline with reload link. Fake-progress animation provides feedback during the longest download on 3G. (index.html, js/main.js) |
| **Internationalisation (i18n)** | Full EN/VI locale system. Key definitions and runtime in `js/i18n.js`; locale files `locales/en.json` + `locales/vi.json`. Auto-detects language via `navigator.language`, persists to `localStorage`. `applyDOM()` walks `[data-i18n]` / `[data-i18n-placeholder]` / `[data-i18n-title]` attributes. Language selector (dropdown + Reload button) in Settings → General. All dynamic UI strings in `main.js`, `hud.js`, `combat.js`, `controls.js`, `items.js`, `hero-viewer.js` use `t('key', vars)`. Covers menus, lobby, multiplayer, HUD, announcer, shop/items, hero viewer, end screen. |
| **Emoji theme polish** | Theme-matching emojis added across UI: flow (⚔️👥▶️), settings (⚙️📋ℹ️🔊🔄), controls (🎮⚔️🎯✨⏹️⌨️🔍🛒), lobby (🤖🛡️📊), multiplayer (🌐➕🔗🗡️📋), HUD (🎯✨⌖), viewer (💤🚶⚔️✨💀❤️📊📈), shop/items (🛡️👟🌿🗡️🔮❤️🩸🌀), announce (💔🏰🌀❌). Loading screen stages (⏳🔊📦⚔️✅❌). Swapped clashing emojis: Easy 😊→🛡️, Ally killed 😢→💔, Bounty Hunter 🥷→🗡️. (locales/en.json, locales/vi.json, index.html, js/hero-viewer.js, js/heroes/sniper.js) |
| **Rebuild (from scratch)** | Full game scaffold per SDLC: `index.html`, `js/` (main, state, scene, constants, map, heroes, hero-models, combat, skills, creeps, towers, items, hud, controls, audio, particles, animations, ai, hero-viewer, net stubs). 100×100 map, 3 lanes, bases, camera follow. 20 hero defs (Lich with 3D model + Frost Nova). Combat: damage formulas, melee/ranged, projectiles, death, respawn. Lane creeps (mid), structures (towers, barracks, ancients), win condition. Menu: side → team size → lobby hero pick → start. HUD: gold, time, HP/MP bars. Controls: click-to-move, Q cast. |
| **Tests & balance** | `#technical` | Unit tests for combat formulas in `tests/combat-formulas.test.js` (physical damage, respawn). Balance reference in `docs/balance.md` (formulas, hero stats, items, XP/gold). Run: `node tests/combat-formulas.test.js`. |
| **Implement & polish (index)** | `#mvp` `#implemented` | Last-hit/deny + gold/XP on creep kill; hero kill bounty + XP; 6 neutral camps (spawn, 60s respawn). HUD: skill bar Q/W/E/R, minimap (click-to-pan), inventory 2×3, shop panel, match end screen (Victory/Defeat), loading overlay. Settings: Hero Viewer first tab, 20-hero list + placeholder preview. Controls: Space stop, B shop, scroll zoom, mobile stubs. Audio: `playSFX` Web Audio fallback (hit, death, gold, buy). Polish: `spawnRing`/death flash in `killUnit`, attack button range gate in HUD. |
